- 👋 Hi, I’m @rohsaurus. I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland - College Park
- 👀 I’m interested in Finance as a field and how it relates to computer science, Information Security, and Machine Learning. I also really enjoy history and alternate history. A few friends and I even have a podcast about alternate history. It's called "Back To the Past The Alternate History Podcast"
- 🌱 I'm currently studying Computer Science at UMD, exploring the different aspects of it and trying to figure out where I want to go!
- 🎮 Currently working on Cerberus, a free application which allows you to easily encrypt and share files without the use of a password! (https://github.com/rohsaurus/Cerberus) I'd love for you to check it out and please contribute if you'd like
- 🔭 I'm a huge Star Trek Fan, and you should be too.
- 📫 If you're interested in reaching out to me, DM me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-parikh-118527221/
