- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rohsaurus. I'm a Senior in high school now, and am taking classes at CCM.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Finance as a field and how it relates to computer science, Information Security, and Machine Learning. I also really enjoy history and alternate history. A few friends and I even have a podcast about alternate history. It's called "Back To the Past The Alternate History Podcast"
- ðŸŒ± I'm planning to major in Computer Science and enter the workforce in either the finance industry or defense industry. 
- ðŸŽ® Currently working on Cerberus, a free application which allows you to easily encrypt and share files without the use of a password! (As of right now, that repo is currently privated)
- ðŸ”­ I'm a huge Star Trek Fan, and you should be too.
- ðŸ“« If you're interested in reaching out to me, DM me on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-parikh-118527221/
