- 👀 I’m interested in Quantitative Finance, and seeing the fields of Math and Computer Science intersect in the financial realm.
- 🌱 I'm currently studying Computer Science at UMD, exploring the different aspects of it and trying to figure out where I want to go!
- 🎮 I'm currently crafting something revolutionary—an all-encompassing communication game changer, akin to GamePigeon but accessible across all devices, with exciting updates coming soon!
- 🔭 I'm a huge Star Trek Fan, and you should be too.
